		<description><![CDATA[Hey Nirmal,

Thank you for your comment. 

Well, to start with, video marketing is not limited to existing or well established businesses only. Itâ€™s also equally beneficial for the startup businesses who are trying to seek and maintain online presence. Videos are more likely to be viewed and shared. People prefer watching videos over reading texts and stats show 64% people  are more likely to buy a product online after watching a video. Interesting, isn&#039;t it? 

But making videos have always been a challenging part for businesses. That is why we have a tool, Picovico â€“ the online slideshow video maker which will help to create musical slideshow videos from your images. You can try making the one &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.picovico.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

Hope this helps :)]]></description>
